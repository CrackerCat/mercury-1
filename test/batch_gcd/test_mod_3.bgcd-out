Running batch GCD on 3 moduli.
Found 3 weak moduli out of 3.
Still need to perform GCD co-factoring on 1 weak moduli.
Work still to do: O(3 * 1) == O(3)
Further found co-factors for 1 weak moduli.
Found vulnerable modulus on line 1: 29bf7 with smallest co-factor 133
Found vulnerable modulus on line 2: 12a15 with smallest co-factor 89
Found vulnerable modulus on line 3: 17b6d with smallest co-factor 89
